# Welcome!

Iâ€™m not a developer, but Iâ€™ve spent years in tech recruiting and I know where the pain points areâ€”manual tracking, repetitive sourcing, and clunky outreach.

So Iâ€™m curating whatâ€™s already out there, learning from open-source bots, and shaping a framework that others can build on.

## What Iâ€™m Exploring

Iâ€™ve been diving into some amazing projects on GitHub that already tackle parts of this:

- [Intelligent Talent Acquisition Bot](https://github.com/sreenjoyroy/INTELLIGENT-TALENT-ACQUISITION-BOT) â€“ Resume screening, outreach, and scheduling with LangChain and Streamlit
- [AGiXT](https://github.com/Josh-XT/AGiXT) â€“ Multi-agent automation platform that could be adapted for recruiting
- [CoreAgent](https://github.com/CoreAgent-Project/CoreAgent) â€“ Lightweight agent framework for task execution

These bots are super inspiring, and Iâ€™m using them as reference points while I sketch out workflows, sourcing logic, and dashboard ideas.

## ðŸ› Tools Iâ€™m Playing With

Even without coding, Iâ€™m experimenting with:
- [Make.com](https://www.make.com/en) â€“ Visual automation builder
- [Zapier](https://zapier.com/pricing) â€“ No-code workflows
- Airtable, Streamlit, and prompt-based sourcing logic

## Why This Repo Exists

This is a space to:
- Document my research and ideas
- Share sourcing workflows and mockups
- Invite collaborators who want to build with me

If youâ€™re a developer, recruiter, or just curious about AI in hiring, Iâ€™d love to connect.
